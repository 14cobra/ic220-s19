## Digital Logic Basics

In this unit, we will develop a basic understanding of boolean arithmetic and
circuit design, which combined, form the foundation of *digital logic*. Building
from this logic, we will see that the circuit design leads directly to the
computation logic built into processing units, or CPUs. 

In this framework, we consider two states:

* a high asserted signal or true state represented by 1,
* and a low asserted signal or false state represented by 0.

Typically, but not always, high asserted (True) is represented by high voltage
settings, while low asserted (False) is represented by low voltage. We typically
consider these voltages carried over wires and manipulated by gates, but we can
also describe this logic using equations.

Below are the standard boolean logic, both in terms of gates and formulas. In
the formulas, the output value is `x` and the first input value is `A` and the
second input value is `B`.
