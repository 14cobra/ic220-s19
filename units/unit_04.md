## Sequential Logic 

So far, we've only consider logic circuits that are *combinational* as they only
compute based on the current input. However, you can imagine computation that is
*sequential*, where the logic takes into account current inputs and previous
inputs. 

A previous input element will be stored in *state elements*, which is updated
based on clock cycle. This requires *feedback circuits* which cannot occur in
combinational circuits.
