# HW 0 : Install QtSPim

Due: 14 Jan 2019

## Instructions

Soon we will have an in-class lab, and you'll need QtSpim to work on your laptop.  Do this:

1. Go to http://www.usna.edu/Users/cs/lmcdowel/courses/ic220/spim/PCSPIM-HowTo.htm

2. Follow the instructions at the very top to install QtSpim.  You do NOT have
   to follow the further instructions on this page after installation (though
   you can if you want to get ahead)

3. After installation, run QtSpim and make sure it starts up.

4. If you have a problem, try to ask a classmate for help.  If you are still
   stuck, send email about this (see below).

5. Ensure that the wireless is working on your machine -- you will need this
   during lab.

6. Send an email to your instructor as follows:
   SUBJECT: spim install: all works
   (no message body  needed)

       OR

   SUBJECT: spim install: problem
   (and describe your problem)

7. You must send one of these emails before the homework deadline for "HW0:
   install QtSpim" shown on the calendar.
