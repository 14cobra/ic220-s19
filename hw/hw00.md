# HW 0 : Install QtSPim

Due: 14 Jan 2019

## Instructions

Soon we will have an in-class lab, and you'll need QtSpim to work on your laptop.  Do this:

1. Go to http://spimsimulator.sourceforge.net/

2. Click the download link and download the latest version of the software, and install. 

3. After installation, run QtSpim and make sure it starts up.

4. If you have a problem, try to ask a classmate for help.  If you are still
   stuck, send email about this (see below).

5. Ensure that the wireless is working on your machine -- you will need this
   during lab.

6. Send an email to your instructor as follows:
   SUBJECT: spim install: all works
   (no message body  needed)

       OR

   SUBJECT: spim install: problem
   (and describe your problem)

7. You must send one of these emails before the homework deadline for "HW0:
   install QtSpim" shown on the calendar.
